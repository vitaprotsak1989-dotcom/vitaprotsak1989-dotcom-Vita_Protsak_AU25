Task 4 — Answers

How can one restrict access to certain columns of a database table?

Use GRANT on specific columns: GRANT SELECT(column1, column2) ON table_name TO role_name;

Use views that expose only selected columns and grant access to the view.

Combine row-level security (RLS) with views to indirectly restrict columns.


What is the difference between user identification and user authentication?

User identification: The process of specifying who the user claims to be (e.g., username).

User authentication: The process of verifying that the claimed identity is correct (e.g., password, certificate).


What are the recommended authentication protocols for PostgreSQL?

SCRAM-SHA-256 (This is the best password-based method, as it's secure and built into PostgreSQL, 
replacing older, less secure methods like MD5.)

Peer authentication (Use this for local connections where the client application can connect 
as the same operating system user. It's a very secure method for local access).

GSSAPI / Kerberos (Provides single sign-on (SSO) and strong security, especially in large organizations with existing Kerberos infrastructure).

LDAP (Integrates with a centralized directory for user authentication.)

Certificate authentication (Uses SSL client certificates for authentication, providing a high level of security).

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) (Allows authentication via the system's PAM infrastructure, providing flexibility in authentication choices). 


What is proxy authentication in PostgreSQL and why is it useful?

Proxy authentication allows a PostgreSQL role to act on behalf of another role for authentication.

It simplifies role-based access control (RBAC) because a single login can switch to subordinate roles with defined privileges.

Example:

SET ROLE client_Patricia_Johnson;
SELECT * FROM public.rental;


Benefit: Easier user management while strictly enforcing role privileges.
